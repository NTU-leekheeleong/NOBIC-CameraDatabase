# NOBIC-CameraDatabase
NOBIC (NTU Optical Bio-Imaging Centre) transforms the field of sensing by bringing image sensing into the digital age for researchers. This database compiles commercially available CMOS cameras from various manufacturers. Key characteristics of camera sensors are measured to facilitate comparison and selection for low cost microscopy applications.
